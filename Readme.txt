Kujata Reborn Readme.txt

Thank you for using the Kujata Reborn Client Installer (KRCI).

Now that your installation is complete, it's advised that you run the Final
Fantasy XI Config tool first. After that, run your Launcher of choice.

If you choose to uninstall the KRCI, it will remove the PlayOnline Viewer, the
Final Fantasy XI client software, and anything in the directory where you chose
to install the KRCI.
